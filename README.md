Python script to be intended to be run in an azure devops pipeline with code hosted in github (shouldn't matter wheres it's hosted though) 

Script is made to be company agnostic, provided you either pass the arguments in when you run the script or just hardcode them in the script itself.

Make sure to run `requirements.txt` before calling the script. This can be done in azure devops with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
